# Text to speech on iOS from Unity 
This is a major restructure of the original repository. This one is focused on only speech to text for iOS and includes an updated example UI to show and select voices. It is also targeted towards Swedish but language can easily can changed in the code. The UI support changing voice, rate och pitch and also callback from native side with info if we are speaking or not.
